# What is this?
This is my personal website for testing HTML code. You're more than welcome to take a walk through it and check it out as well as view my portfolio. Do keep in mind that a lot of it is still brand new and that there's a ton of work needing done. It's literally a blank white page with black text right now talking about this.

# How did you make this?
Github Pages, a lot of patience, and some trial and error. You should look up a tutorial on how to do the same. It's actually kinda fun, not gonna lie.

# Can I contact you to make a website like this for me?

No.
