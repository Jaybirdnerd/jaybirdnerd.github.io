                    <b>Slot Info</b> - I reserve the right to revoke your slot between start date to end date of your artwork being made if my terms are violated.
                    All sold slots are final, no refunds or reissues will be given once your artwork has been started.
                </p>

                <li><p>
                    <b>Copyright</b> - If you post your commissioned piece publicly to social media, please post the watermarked version with a link back to my page as credit.
                    You are not allowed to post the un-watermarked piece to your social medias/etc without my consent.
                    <br><br>
                    As well: Please do not take credit for my artwork if you post it publicly. You are also not allowed to claim it as something you drew yourself.
                     You are also allowed to modify and transform commissioned pieces in any way wanted, however a credit for the original art if posted publicly is required.
                      My artwork is meant for non-commercial use unless directly stated otherwise.
                    <br><br>
                    If you do not own the rights to the characters being drawn and it is not explicitly fan art of existing characters in pop culture or media (i.e. Fan Art of Travis Touchdown,
                    Fan art of Samus Aran, Fan art of Brad Armstrong, so on), then you are required to have permission from the original creator of the character you are requesting
                    artwork of. This does not apply to 'gift art' between you and the original creator of the character as it is contextually different.

                    <p>
                        <b>Portfolio Credit</b> - Let me know beforehand if you'd like the piece kept private or public prior to finish and if you're comfortable with it being published in my
                         catalogue of public works with credit given for the character as typically most of my commissioned works are published as part of my portfolio and on social media.

                    <p>
                        <b>Changes</b> - You are allowed up to a max of 3 total edits/requests for fixes to be made to your piece before a charge of 10$ is expected with each edit request. 
                        This policy is flexible and is in place to conserve my time dedicated towards a piece as typically there are more than one person(s) in line to receive their works.

                        <b>Payment</b> - Please do not send transactions as business transactions. Personal to Personal please, otherwise I will refund your money and refuse service. I also do not use 
	                    venmo, cashapp, or any other alternative means of transaction that is not paypal. <i class="glowing-text"> I DO NOT, NOR EVER WILL, WORK FOR: INTERNET FUN BUCKS, BITCOIN,
                         EXPOSURE, FIRST BORN CHILDREN, YOUR SOUL, YOUR LEFT NUT, BOTH TITTIES, OR ANY NON-MONETARY MEANS. IF YOU ASK, I WILL SAY NO EVERY TIME.</i>

                    <p>
                        <b>Deadline Requests</b> - I tend to take a long time getting art done, it's understandable if you want to set a deadline or pay after the works are finished. However, you are expected
                    	to pay when the work is finished or when the deadline has arrived otherwise I refuse to submit the finished and un-watermarked piece.
                    	I am also very understanding when it comes to payment flexability and will work with the other person to meet a reasonable price point if applicable.

                    <p>
                        You are 100% required to provide some sort of reference material before I can begin working on your artwork. It can be references of any kind as long as 
                    	an in-depth clarification is given as to their general appearance.
                    </p>

                        It is strongly recommended to pay attention to my trello page as typically information about a given artwork or commission slot is put there. You can, however, DM me 
                    	and ask me about your artwork; However, do not dogpile me and spam me daily. It will be done when it is done.

                        <b>NSFW Information</b> - If you commission a NSFW (Not Safe For Work) piece the characters must be over the age of 18.<i class="glowing-text"> If you request anything that borders on Lolicon, Cub, or otherwise
                        you will be rejected on the spot.</i>
                        <br>
                        <b>Fetish Content</b> - If you request something that falls into fetish content, you are required to tell me prior to the start of your piece being drawn.
                    </p>

            <!--<center>What to Expect</center>
            <br>
            <center><p>When you commission me, keep the following in mind: </p></center>
            <ul>
                <li>
                 <p>
                    There will be time constraints due to my personal life getting in the way. Naturally, IRL comes first over this. Taking commissions is a hobby more than it is a day job for me,
                    however, do not hesitate to contact me should you feel it required. Sometimes I do genuinely need reminders that things exist.

                        A Zip File containing the following will be given to you once the artwork(s) have been finished: your reference images, rendered finished artwork(s) in .png format, .csp files of your finished artwork(s).
